You are a senior Flutter developer.

Build a simple and clean Flutter Android app for restaurant owners to place daily orders to vendors using WhatsApp.

Target users:
- Restaurant / cloud kitchen owners
- Non-technical users

Core problem:
Restaurant owners currently have to open WhatsApp, search vendor names, and manually type item orders.
This app should reduce time and effort.

App requirements:

1. Home Screen – Item Selection
- Show a scrollable list of grocery / kitchen items
- Each item should have:
  - Checkbox
  - Quantity input field (optional, default 1)
- Example items:
  Onion, Tomato, Potato, Paneer, Cheese, Cooking Oil, Chicken

2. Vendor Selection Screen
- Show a list of vendors with:
  - Checkbox (single selection only)
  - Vendor name
  - WhatsApp number stored in code
- Example vendors:
  - Ramesh Veg Supplier – 91XXXXXXXXXX
  - Suresh Dairy – 91XXXXXXXXXX
  - Chicken Center – 91XXXXXXXXXX

3. Order Message Generation
- When user clicks "Send Order":
  - Generate a professional WhatsApp message automatically
  - Format example:

    Hello {{Vendor Name}} 👋
    Please send the following items:

    • Onion – 5 kg
    • Tomato – 3 kg
    • Paneer – 2 kg

    Thank you
    - {{Restaurant Name}}

4. WhatsApp Integration
- Use WhatsApp URL intent (https://wa.me/)
- Do NOT auto-send message
- Open WhatsApp chat with message pre-filled

5. UI / UX
- Clean, minimal UI
- Large buttons (easy for shop owners)
- Dark mode support
- Material Design
- No login required

6. Technical constraints
- Flutter (latest stable)
- Single codebase
- Beginner-friendly code
- Proper comments explaining logic
- No backend (local data only)
- Use url_launcher package

7. Deliverables
- Complete working Flutter code
- main.dart + necessary models
- pubspec.yaml dependencies
- Clear instructions on how to run and build APK

Important:
- Keep code simple
- Avoid over-engineering
- Focus on usability
- Assume the developer is a beginner

Return:
- Step-by-step explanation
- Full copy-paste ready code
